Real Madrid secured a convincing 3-1 victory over arch-rivals Barcelona in an enthralling El Clásico at the Santiago Bernabéu. Vinicius Junior opened the scoring before Lewandowski equalized, but second-half goals from Bellingham and Rodrygo sealed the win for the hosts.

## First Half

The match began with intense pressure from both sides, with neither team willing to give an inch. Real Madrid looked dangerous on the counter-attack, with Vinicius Junior causing problems for Barcelona's defense with his pace and skill.

The deadlock was broken in the 23rd minute when Vinicius received a perfect through ball from Bellingham, cut inside, and fired a powerful shot into the top corner, giving the goalkeeper no chance.

Barcelona responded well and found an equalizer in the 37th minute. After a well-worked move down the left flank, Raphinha delivered a precise cross that Lewandowski converted from close range.

## Second Half

The second half saw Real Madrid come out with renewed energy. Their persistence paid off in the 62nd minute when a partially cleared corner fell to Bellingham, who unleashed a stunning volley into the bottom corner.

Barcelona pushed forward in search of another equalizer, but this left them vulnerable at the back. Real Madrid capitalized in the 79th minute when a quick counter-attack culminated in Rodrygo slotting the ball past the onrushing goalkeeper.
